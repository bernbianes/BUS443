- **Student details:** Displays student information (first name, last name, major, year and GPA). Uses pagination to limit a single view to show only 10 students at a time.

When a student and book name is selected, on click of the “Reserve” button, the book should be reserved for thatstudent. The book reservation should be successful under the criteria that no other student has reserved the book. Uses ajax to send the data to the backend.
